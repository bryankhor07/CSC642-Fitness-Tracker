## Project Description
Being fit is a crucial part of a healthy lifestyle. In order to be fit, we humans need to exercise. There are many ways we can exercise such as cardio, weightlifting, stretching, meditation, and many others. Oftentimes, we exercise without keeping track of the time, distance, and intensity and it is important to keep track of this information to gain a comprehensive understanding of our fitness journey. By monitoring these information, we not only ensure a balanced energy intake but also empower ourselves to make informed decisions regarding our nutrition , optimize our workouts, and work towards achieving our specific health and fitness goals. Therefore, we decided to create a web application that provides a personalized log where the user can choose the type of exercise and keep track of information like time, distance, and intensity.
